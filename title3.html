            <h2><a name="WhatisExpress.js">What is Express.js?</a></h2>
            <p>Express.js is a free and open-source web application framework for Node.js. It is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily. Web applications are web apps that you can run on a web browser. Since Express.js only requires javascript, it becomes easier for programmers and developers to build web applications and API without any effort.</p>
            <p>is a framework of Node.js which means that most of the code is already written for programmers to work with. You can build a single page, multi-page, or hybrid web applications using Express.js. Express.js is lightweight and helps to organize web applications on the server-side into a more organized MVC architecture.</p>
            <p> It is important to learn javascript and HTML to be able to use Express.js. Express.js makes it easier to manage web applications.It is a part of a javascript based technology called MEAN software stack which stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js. Express.js is the backend part of MEAN and manages routing, sessions, HTTP requests, error handling, etc.</p>  
            <p> The JavaScript library of Express.js helps the programmers to build efficient and fast web apps.  Express.js enhances the functionality of the node.js. In fact, if you donâ€™t use Express.js, then you have to do a lot of complex programming to build an efficient API. It has made programming in node.js effortless and has given many additional features</p>
            <h2><a name="WhyshouldyouuseExpress.js">Why should you use Express.js?</a></h2>
            <p>Express.js supports JavaScript which is a widely used language that is very easy to learn and is also supported everywhere. Therefore, if you already know JavaScript, then it will be really easy for you to do programming using Express.js.</p>
            <p>With the help of Express.js, you can easily build different kinds of web applications in a short period of time. Express.js provides a simple routing for requests made by clients. It also provides a middleware that is responsible for making decisions to give the correct responses for the requests made by the client</p>
            <p>Without Express.js, you have to write your own code to build a routing component which is a time consuming and tedious task. Express.js offers simplicity, flexibility, efficiency, minimalism, and scalability to the programmers. It also has the advantage of powerful performance as it is a framework of Node.js.</p>
            <p>Node.js carries all the executions really fast with the help of Event Loop that avoids any kind of inefficiency. The powerful performance of Node.js and the ease of coding using Express.js are the most popular features loved by web application developers. Since Express.js is written in Javascript, you can build websites, web applications, or even mobile apps using it.</p>
